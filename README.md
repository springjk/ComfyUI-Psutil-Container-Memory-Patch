# ComfyUI Psutil Container Memory Patch

## Overview

This extension is designed to address the issue where ComfyUI, when running in a memory-limited container, fails to correctly detect the available memory size. 

ComfyUI and some of its nodes use the `psutil` library. Due to historical reasons, the `psutil.virtual_memory` function cannot accurately read the container's available and maximum memory limitsâ€”it instead retrieves the host machine's memory statistics. This discrepancy can lead to OOM (Out of Memory) errors in certain tasks.

## Solution
This extension detects whether ComfyUI is running inside a container, reads the container's memory limits, and applies a Monkey Patch to override specific return values of `psutil.virtual_memory`. Currently, it modifies the following memory metrics:
- **Total memory (`total`)**
- **Used memory (`used`)**
- **Available memory (`available`)**
- **Memory usage percentage (`percent`)**

By doing so, the memory statistics correctly reflect the container's actual limits rather than the host machine's resources.

## Benefits
With this extension:  
- ComfyUI and its nodes can make informed decisions based on accurate memory constraints.  
- OOM (Out of Memory) errors are effectively prevented in containerized environments.  
- Memory-related nodes (such as **crytools' Statistic Node**) now display correct usage information.  

``` bash
# Run ComfyUI in container with 10GB memory limit

# Before installing node, console displays:
python /root/ComfyUI/main.py

	ComfyUI starting ..
	Total VRAM 24210 MB, total RAM 102400 MB

# After installing node, console displays: 
python /root/ComfyUI/main.py

	ComfyUI starting ..
	Total VRAM 24210 MB, total RAM 10240 MB
```


## Install

1. Look up `Psutil Container Memory Patch` in ComfyUI-Manager. If you are installing manually, clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
1. Restart ComfyUI.

# Features

- Make comfyui  and other custom node get correct memory information in the container (psutil monkey path)
